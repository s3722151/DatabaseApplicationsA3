This is an assignment where I combine the use of using MongoDB, making a Web Application and presumably use sharding.

UPDATE:
learn the basics of combining MongoDB and javascript 
frameworks such as node.js, express etc to build a fullstack web application. 


Steps
1. Download the necessary software
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Node 
- Download MongoDB
Fortunately I already installed it in advance.
